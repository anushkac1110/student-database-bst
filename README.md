# Student Database Management System using Binary Search Tree (C++)

A menu-driven C++ application that manages student records using a
Binary Search Tree (BST). Each student record contains roll number,
name, and marks.

---

##  Features
- Insert new student records
- Search student by roll number
- Delete student records
- Display records using:
  - Inorder traversal
  - Preorder traversal
  - Postorder traversal
- Find student with:
  - Highest marks
  - Lowest marks
- Count total number of students

---

##  Concepts Used
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Recursion
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Tree traversals
- Menu-driven program design

---

##  Purpose
This project was developed to strengthen understanding of tree-based
data structures and demonstrate how Binary Search Trees can be used
for efficient data storage and retrieval.

---

##  How to Run

1. Download the file `student_bst.cpp`
2. Compile using a C++ compiler:
g++ student_bst.cpp -o bst
3. Run the program:
